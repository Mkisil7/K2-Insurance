                        <p>Insurance is a financial safety net that protects you from unexpected losses. It provides peace of mind by covering the costs of accidents, damages, or other covered events. Without insurance, you would be responsible for paying these costs out of pocket, which could be financially devastating.</p>

                        <p>Choosing the right coverage depends on your individual needs, assets, and risk tolerance. Our experienced agents will help you assess your situation and recommend appropriate coverage levels. We consider factors like your assets, income, family situation, and specific risks you face.</p>

                        <p>Whether you need full coverage depends on your car's value and your financial situation. If your car is worth less than what you'd pay in premiums and deductibles, you might consider dropping collision and comprehensive coverage. However, you should always maintain liability coverage as required by law.</p>
